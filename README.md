# MM3-EntityStrike
An script that has been in the development for quite a while now, I don't really know why you are trying to read this unless you're a skid who's trying to leak my code and make it open source so the devs will patch the script. One of the premium hubs for MM3 as there are little to none GUI's for MM3 and out of all of them, I could proclaim that this hub is the best. Features include, Teleport to Murder/Sheriff/Revolver, Knife Duping, Dex Explorer, Infinite Yield, Collect all Coins, Auto-Unboxer and many more. Frequent un-patch updates and bug fixes. (There is only one developer working on this though, so please don't expect me to be able to react instantly since scripting still takes time.) Also special message for skids, STOP TRYING TO LEAK MY CODE! Just use the loadstring and stop complaining about the trash UI, I'm still finding a better-looking UI >:(

Since it's initial release for purchase and beta testing, I have added a lot of new functions and fixed a lot of bugs that were found on the way, until I decided on 23/2/2021 to release it to the public, since I didn't want to have a paywall blocking people from using my hub. (FYI I removed the entire key-system so you won't need any keys) If you'd like to help with the code/help develop then you can DM me, my username on discord is ecez#9573. Other than that, have a nice time flooding the chat-system with unboxing messages =D
